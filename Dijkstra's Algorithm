Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm always attempts to select the "closest" vertex in V-S to add to set S,
	
	Where S is the set of vertives for which the algorithm has determined the shortest paths for (from starting vertex s)

	Therfore, it's a "greedy" algorithm

//given graphe G with weights on edges defined by w 
//determine shortest paths to all vertices from start vertex s (including unreachable ones)

procedure Dijkstra(G, w, s)
{
	INIT-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s)

	S = <empty-set>

	//use priority queue with dist d as the key
	Q = G.v		i.e insert all vertices into QUEUE

	while Q not empty
	{
		u = EXTRACT-MIN(Q)	(de-queue operation)
		add u to set S

		foreach vertex v that's adjacent to u
		{
			RELAX(u, v, w)
			Reorder Q based on adjuested dist v.d
		}
	}
}
